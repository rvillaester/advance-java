Supplier
    - Supplies an instance of given type by constructor or some other way
Producer
    - Gets an object, uses it but return no response
Predicate
    - Represents an operation that takes a single input and returns a boolean value.
Optional
    - Saves us from checking if the object is null

All of these are single abstract method interfaces. Can be replaced by lambda expression.
