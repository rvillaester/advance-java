What is Stream?
    - is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels
    - donâ€™t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods

Different operations in stream
    - Intermediate Operations: map, filter, sorted etc
        - these operations will just return another stream which then you can invoke any stream operators
    - Terminal Operations: collect, reduce, forEach etc
        - these operations either return a value or print something
        - no further stream operations can be invoke after a terminal operation
